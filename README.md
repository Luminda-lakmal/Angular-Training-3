Angular Training 3
==================
1. create a new angular project with routing enabled --> do not continue with any of your old projects for this
2. create 2 components -> PublicBase, PrivateBase
3. create 3 modules called, Student, Courses and MyTesting -->important
4. Student module should have, AddStudent, ShowStudents, EditStudent (don't use add student for this, create a new component)
5. Courses module should have AddCourse, ShowCourses, EditCourse (don't use AddCourse component for this, create a new one)
6. PrivateBase should have a navbar, it must have links to all the components in given modules
7. create a login component
8. at the start of the application it should point to login
9. any incorrect routing should point to login as well (wild cards)
10. add bootstrap to the project, use npm for this. (don't just add links from the top or add it manually)
11. when clicking on each link in the navbar, it should go to the correct component
12. login should use public base
13. use the routing correctly
14. dont forget to use the child routs, that point to each module's router
